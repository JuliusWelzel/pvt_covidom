; === Storage Location ===
; the default file name can be something like C:\\Recordings\\untitled.xdf, but can also contain
; placeholders. Two placeholder formats are supported: Legacy and BIDS.
;
; Legacy may contain a running number (incremented per experiment session) called %n, and a 
; placeholder for a "block" label %b (if the config script provides a list of block names that 
; consitute a session.
; The syntax is as in: StorageLocation = "C:\\Recordings\\subject%n\\block_%b.xdf"
;
; For BIDS, the path may contain %p for participant label, %s for session label,
; %b for task label (same as block in Legacy), %a for name of acquisition parameter set, and %r index.
; The BIDS syntax is: path/to/CurrentStudy/sub-%p/ses-%s/eeg/sub-%p_ses-%s_task-%b[_acq-%a]_run-%r_eeg.xdf
;
; If StorageLocation is not provided then the default is QStandardPaths::DocumentsLocation/CurrentStudy/exp%n/untitled.xdf

StorageLocation	=	"C:/Users/juliu/Desktop/kiel/int_trmr_eeg/04_data/00_pilot_LSL_all/sub-%p/ses-%s/eeg/sub-%p_ses-%s_task-%b[_acq-%a]_run-%r_eeg.xdf"

; === Study Root ===
; You can optionally provide only the study root folder and it will be used to build a file name automatically.
; The default filename builder is Legacy (see above).


; === Block Names ===
; This is optionally a list of blocks that make up a recording session. The blocks are displayed in 
; a list box where the experiment can select a block before pressing record. If used, the blocks 
; may serve as a reminder of where they are in the experiment, but more practically, can be 
; used to determine the file name of the recording. Power users can define scriptable actions 
; associated with selecting a block or pressing Start/Stop for a given block (e.g., for remote 
; control).
; The syntax is as in: SessionBlocks = "Training","PreBaseline","MainSection","PostBaseline"

SessionBlocks	=	"isometric_tremor", "resting_state"

; === Required Streams ===
; This is optionally a list of streams that are required for the recording; 
; a warning is issued if one of the streams is not present when the record button is pressed
; The syntax is as in: RequiredStreams = "BioSemi (MyHostname)","PhaseSpace (MyHostname)","Eyelink (AnotherHostname)"
; where the format is identical to what the LabRecorder displays in the "Record from streams" list.

RequiredStreams	=	"Fsr (DESKTOP-CH8AT6E)", "PsychoPyMarker (DESKTOP-CH8AT6E)","pupil-capture (DESKTOP-CH8AT6E)","Delsys (DESKTOP-CH8AT6E)"
